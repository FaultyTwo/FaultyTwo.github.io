                <div>Ah. Look who&apos;s finally arrived. Welcome. I&apos;m willing to answer ... but not much.</div>
                <div>My name is 
                    <span className="text-green-highlight">&nbsp;&quot;Chawin&quot;.&nbsp;</span> 
                    You can call me by my nickname, 
                    <span className="text-green-highlight">&nbsp;&quot;Win&quot;,&nbsp;</span>
                    or go with the internet alias, 
                    <span className="text-green-highlight">&nbsp;&quot;FaultyTwo&quot;.&nbsp;</span></div>
                <div>
                    My main career involves software development and server maintenance (if I have to). 
                    But my presence on the internet is mainly about video games, niches and obscure topics.

                <div className="text-[28px] font-bold">
                    # Q: &quot;What&apos;s the deal with &apos;FaultyTwo&apos;?&quot;
                </div>
                <div>
                    Back in the prehistorical age (around 2011?). I was a naive kid whose first 
                    ACTUAL gaming experience was through a cracked client of Minecraft and AMD A10-5700. 
                    In that year, it was also the first time I created a YouTube channel I won&apos;t disclose, 
                    to get a foot into the life as a netizen.
                </div>
                <div>
                    In 2012. I created another alt account called &quot;mapmaker42&quot; as a 
                    secondary channel. The reason behind the name? Minecraft mapping, 
                    plus forty-two (the number) because of the 
                    <span className="text-green-highlight italic font-bold">&nbsp;&quot;420 BLAZE IT&quot;&nbsp;</span>
                    catchphrase.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Around 2013. I don&apos;t recall the reason but I decided to move my main to 
                    <span className="text-green-highlight">&nbsp;&quot;mapmaker42&quot;.&nbsp;</span>
                    In those days. I was somewhat an &quot;animator&quot; and mainly animated &quot;object shows&quot; 
                    for fun and social.
                </div>
                <div>
                    And then I purged them in 2015 because I thought they were &quot;cringe&quot;. *facepalm*
                </div>
                <div>
                    Around ... actually, I don&apos;t remember. Let&apos;s say somewhere between 2017 to 
                    2018. Taking advantage of the channel renaming feature, I decided to &quot;rebrand&quot; my 
                    channel to &quot;FaultyTwo&quot;. 
                    <span className="text-green-highlight">&nbsp;&quot;FaultyTwo&quot;&nbsp;</span> 
                    is the name I got from the number &quot;42&quot; plus 
                    a bad pun on the pronunciation mixed with low self-esteem.
                </div>
                <div>
                    And for the rest is history as you know it.
                </div>
